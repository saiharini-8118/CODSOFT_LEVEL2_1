      <p>
        Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was not just a scientist or a president—he was a visionary, a teacher, and an inspiration to millions. Born in 1931 in the small town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he rose from humble beginnings to become one of the most respected figures in Indian history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known as the "Missile Man of India" for his work with ISRO and DRDO, he played a key role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests. Beyond science, he had a deep love for education and youth development. His speeches, books, and words continue to ignite passion and purpose among students across the nation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Kalam’s presidency (2002–2007) was marked by humility, accessibility, and hope. Even after his term, he chose to spend his time teaching and mentoring, proving his dedication to building a better India through knowledge and innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        He passed away in 2015 while doing what he loved—delivering a lecture to young minds. His legacy, however, lives on forever in our hearts and aspirations.
